### What is this

This is an attempt to reproduce the Illinois letterhead in latex.  This uses the new brand, the [block-I](http://creativeservices.illinois.edu/brand/).

### How to use

The official letterhead appears to use the [Gotham](https://www.typography.com/fonts/gotham/overview/) font.  A close, available alternative is is the [Montserrat](https://ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/montserrat?lang=en) font, which is used here and is included in TexLive.

Use `template.tex`, it includes the logo and font style through `illinois.tex`.
